# 🏔️ Summit International CTF – Security Analysis Portfolio

This repository showcases a curated set of security challenges, source code, and in-depth analytical writeups developed as part of an ongoing cybersecurity skills portfolio. The focus is on **analysis, detection, and defensive understanding of real-world vulnerabilities**, rather than offensive misuse.

The challenges reflect scenarios commonly encountered in **SOC operations, incident response, malware analysis, and application security**, emphasizing **methodical investigation, evidence correlation, and professional reporting**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This project serves as a **public portfolio** demonstrating proficiency in:

- Security alert triage and root-cause analysis  
- Reverse engineering and memory inspection  
- Web application vulnerability analysis  
- Network traffic and log analysis  
- Translating technical findings into executive-level reports  

All material is designed for **educational and defensive security training**.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each challenge is intentionally split into **two distinct artifacts**.

---

### 📝 Walkthroughs (Analysis & Methodology)

- **`[number].txt` files**

These files contain **full analytical writeups**, including:

- Threat and vulnerability identification  
- Investigation approach and tooling  
- Evidence analysis  
- Flag discovery rationale  
- Defensive and detection takeaways  

These writeups demonstrate **how to think like a security analyst**, not just how to exploit a flaw.

---

### 💻 Challenge Source Code

All other files (`.c`, `.py`, `.php`, `.html`, `.js`, `.sql`, etc.) represent **intentionally vulnerable challenge code** used to support the analysis documented in the walkthroughs.

The code exists to:

- Provide realistic artifacts for analysis  
- Enable reverse engineering and inspection  
- Support lab-based learning environments  

---

## 🧩 Challenge Domains

### 🔐 Validation & Authentication Logic

- Behavioral anomaly detection

---

### 🧾 Reporting & Communication
Focus areas include:
- Technical incident documentation
- Executive-level summaries
- Evidence-based reporting standards

---

## 🏁 Flags

All challenges use a consistent flag format:


Flags are used solely as **verification artifacts** and may be encoded, fragmented, or discovered through analysis rather than direct output.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Demonstrated

- Ghidra and GDB  
- Wireshark and packet inspection  
- CyberChef  
- Browser Developer Tools  
- Linux command-line utilities  
- Secure coding and analysis principles  

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

This portfolio highlights skills relevant to:

- SOC Analyst (Tier I–III)  
- Incident Response  
- Malware Analysis  
- Detection Engineering  
- Reverse Engineering (foundational)  
- Technical and Executive Reporting  

---

## 🧪 Safe Usage

- Run all challenges in **isolated lab environments only**  
- Do **not** deploy to production systems  
- No live targets or real data  

---

## 📜 Ethical Notice

This repository exists solely for **defensive security education and professional skill demonstration**. No material is intended for unauthorized or malicious use.
