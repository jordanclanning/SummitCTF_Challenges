You can easily view the flag within Ghidra
    its under "ApprovedExec" 
            ** Had to modify that then saved the binary
            once the binary was saved,
            I used chmod +x FILE to access it.


added a text FILE
 """

Only authorized executives can see this flag.

Dont spend too much time trying to guess the name. You can guess all you want, only a few have gotten it purely from guessing. 

Try using some RE tools if you get stuck.
